   Applications  which  can  be  used  in  different  platforms  (e.g.   PC,  phone,  tablet)  now  use  two
factor authentication (2FA) to allow users to conveniently switch from one platform to another.
For example, when a user tries to login his gmail, it is not enough to enter correct password (first
factor), it is also necessary to enter a PIN which is received by an SMS (second factor).  The aim
of this project explaining the attacks against 2FA in IOS and Android devices and what it can
be the solution.
