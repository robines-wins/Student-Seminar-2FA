\begin{abstract}
Applications  which  can  be  used  in  different  platforms  now  use  two
factor authentication (2FA) to allow users to conveniently switch from one platform to another.
For example, when a user tries to login his gmail, it is not enough to enter correct password 
(first factor), it is also necessary to enter a PIN which is received by an SMS (second factor).
The aim of this project explaining the attacks against 2FA in IOS and Android devices and 
what can be the solutions.

\section{Introduction: The current 2 Factors Authentication}

Two factor authentication (2FA) is a combination of 2 access control  in order to make it more robust to attacker.The general model is that to authenticate yourself to an online service you both need to provide an information you know (your password) and use a physical object you have. 
One of the most most used "physical object" is a phone or a smartphone
as large majority of people in today's world has one.
More specifically, it's the fact it's possible, through this phone, to send a message who will not transit by the (maybe compromised) PC 
who is used. your smartphone is used as an out of band channel.

As their exist other 2FA scheme we will only study here the ones using smartphone as they are the most frequent used. Moreover the attack will focus on SMS based scheme.
It make sense to focus attack only on this SMS based 2FA because, as it will discussed later most of the service offering more secure 2FA scheme on smartphone also propose this one as a backup solution.

The precise scheme assumed here is the following: assuming we want to authentication to a service on a PC, after a successful password authentication, the user is required to enter (on the PC) a One-Time Passwords (OTP) send by SMS to the phone in order to fully authenticate to the service. 

This paper will present 2 attack to break this authentication assuming a compromise PC and a sane smartphone. The former is to be used on android smartphone, the later on Ios.

This paper is essentially based on AAAAAAAAAAAAAA by BBBBBBBBB

%\subsection{2FA: 2 Factors Authentification}
\section{Key concepts}
Before describing precisely the attack, this section will explain and summarize the Key concept used by the 2 two attack,  The first subsection will describe what is synchronization and why it's a threat to the 2FA concept. the second describe the setup in which we assume the attack are performed: the phone is sane. the PC is compromised and is able perform a Man in the Browser attack.
\subsection{Synchronization}
Our use of informatics is mostly divided between our personal computers 
and smartphones. for this reason software manufacturer have sometime decided to implement synchronization processes between the 2 devices in order to make transition and general use of the 2 smoother, blurring the line between the two. This mean that the smartphone is less and less out of band with respect to the PC, which is the main assumption done by 2FA scheme using smartphone.

3 example of such synchronization who will be used in our attack are the 
following:
\begin{description}
  \item[Google play remote install] it's possible from a PC via the google play 
  website to remotly install an application on our phone if both are logged on 
  the same google account. the only thing appering on the phone afterward is the 
  application incon in the app tray and an notification saying ``<app\_name> as been succesfully installed'' 
  
  \item[Apple Continuity] On recent version of Ios and macOs you can enable this 
  setting to syncronise in clear, read and send your SMS from your mac.
  
  \item[Browser syncronisation] Allmost all of today's most popular internet browser 
  propose syncornization beetween theire mobile and desktop version logged under same user account.
  it will sync history, boommark and sometime currently open tabs 
\end{description}
\subsection{MitB: Man in the browser attack}
MitB is a type of attack who assume that the attacker has an entier control and view on the PC browser of the victim. Like a man in the middle attack, the attaker can see all data 
exchanged by the browser and server and can modify them (on the fly). it also can send and receive data in the name of the user. But unlike the former it has acces to these data before they encrypted (or after they are decryted) And has also modify browser related setting like bookmark and current open tabs URLs. In short powerfull man in the browser attack can remotelly perform the same actions has someone getting physical acces to the browser

there are different way to do a MitB attack, using malware infecting the whole system, by API hooking or via malicious plugin. TO COMPLETE ?
\section{2FA Attack on }
\subsection{Android}
The principle to the attack is to, via a MitB, install from the web play-store anapplication from with autorization to read SMS (autorisation confirmed from the browser 
too). Then when an SMS is received it is forward to the attacker, thus bypassing 
F2A. In order to succed the attacker need to pass two defense setup by Google.

\paragraph{Bypassing Google boncer} llzezeffe

\paragraph{Activate the app} When installed, an Android app can't be triggered by external event (such as RECEIVE\_SMS) until it has been explicitly open for the first time. So we need to trick the user to open the app from the phone. The 
first way is to give a clickbait title to the app so that the user will be tempted to open it when he sees the installation notification.The second is to trigger its opening from the mobile browser by cliking a link

\subsection{Ios}
Since 2015 Ios has forbid the application to read all 
notificatino or SMS without explicit autorization (or they will be rejected from entering the appstore). 
Since then, the previous attack does not work. 

However if the infected browser is on a Mac and Continity 
is activated on the Iphone. the browser can still has acces to to SMS in clear 
on the mac as soon as both are on the same LAN, which is likely to eventually occurs
as they belong to the same person. 

So under these pretty likely to appers conditons, the 2FA authentification can 
be very easily bypassed on 2FA by an MitB attack.
